DrupalConsole RC-1 is close, is really really close, as close as DrupalCon Dublin, less than a week at least thats our goal.

### Where are we?

We accomplish a lot of changes during the last two months, and this is an overview of the milestones completed for RC-1 release.

\* Languages separated from the main project.  


\* Core commands and features to be shared across projects.  


\* Main repo.  


\* New global executable.   


### What is next?

The next step is to fix modules with current DrupalConsole integrations once RC-1 is released, this means next week during DrupalCon.

This is the list of the known contributed commands providing commands, we have identified and we are planning to help update and fix to be RC-1 compatible.

- Metatag
- Webprofiler
- Drupal Commerce
- Configuration Split
- Scheduled Updates

If you know of another module(s) with contributes command please let us know by commenting on this post or on this issue 

### Are we done and ready for the stable ?

Not yet, we are close and we will continue working to complete the stable release and you help us complete it. This is how you can help.

#### Are you a business owner?

As a business owner has your company already leveraged the advantages of Drupal Console?. Will Drupal Console play a significant role in your business plan for your immersion in Drupal 8?

You can contribute to complete the Goals for our 1.0.0 stable release by assigning 1 or more of your resources to work in office hours to complete the pending tasks.

#### Are you an independent developer?

As an independent developer, you can help us by allocating some hours. We always have issues to resolve and none of them are rocket science!

### Are you going to DrupalCon?


Feel free to join us during the sprints, you can help us in several ways:

- Fix current modules with integrations.
- Fix bugs and improve the project.
- Write an integration for a contrib module.
- If you know how to write test for Drupal 8, we really need your help.
