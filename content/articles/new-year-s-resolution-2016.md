Some people take their resolutions seriously others just call it a second chance to dream with their eyes open, but no one can deny having made some.

Within the Drupal Console Core team, we include our new year's resolution as part of the project Roadmap, and we want to share it with you.

Let's elaborate each one by one.

1. Spread the word.
-------------------

We have to recognize the amazing work done by Jesus Manuel Olivas traveling across the USA mostly participating in as many DrupalCamps he could do in 2015, included some special spots in Colombia and Brasil. Also, enzo a.k.a Eduardo Garcia :P. for spreading the word in UK, Canada, Turkey, and Chile (intentionally we don't mention events on their living countries)

Therefore, we are planning to continue with this effort in 2016.

[Jesus Manuel Olivas](http://www.jmolivas.com) will continue with his impressive job attending events at USA and will include more camps in Latam, for instance, the Drupal Summit Latino in Sao Paulo, Brasil.

On the other hand, [enzo](http://www.enzolutions.com) will start in February a "Drupal around the world tour in 120 days" visiting several countries in Asia and Oceania. We will publish details about this in a future post.

2. Defeat the language barrier.
-------------------------------

If you are reading this article, for sure, you can understand English. But sadly that is only a reality for about less than 10% of the world population.

For that reason, we want to continue looking for volunteers to help us to complete current project translations.  
   
 At this point, we have Drupal Console translated into twelve languages (not all of them are 100% completed). But we want to include more languages to enable more people to get involve with Drupal 8 development and usage in their native language.

3. Develop and deploy faster and more efficient.
------------------------------------------------

The Drupal Console project has 100+ commands grouped on several namespaces. These commands can help you with some of the most common tasks in Drupal 8, as generate code, interact the system and other daily administration tasks.

We want to identify the most typical activities in your day to day development tasks, to add new features.

Additionally, we want to include features related to the deployment process to facilitate the transition across multiple environments.

4. Stop using reverse engineering.
----------------------------------

For years, this the most popular method to learn how the code works. But the fact that is what we usually do; doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.

We add the "--learning" option in our generators, with this option we provide a human readable explanation of the generated classes and methods. This feature also takes advantage of the multi-language functionality, that means you will learn Drupal 8 in your mother tongue.

However, that only works with few commands. For that reason, we want to support the learning feature in as many commands as we could.

Wrapping things up.
-------------------

Finally, how we will plan to achieve our goals? Of course, these cannot be accomplished only by the Drupal Console Core maintainers. We expect the support of our 110+ contributors, and naturally, we hope the trend of people willing to contribute to the Drupal Console project continue in 2016.
