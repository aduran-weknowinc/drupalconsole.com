It’s hard to believe that we have reached two millions downloads, considering that the DrupalConsole reached its [first million](https://drupalconsole.com/articles/drupal-console-hits-1-million-downloads) less than a year ago.

Getting to that first million involved almost 4 years to reach that level of trust within the community. Back then we were in version 1.0.0-rc23, and we were working really hard to launch the official release before DrupalCon Vienna. To be honest, we were aiming for the first 1.0.0 release to be out by DrupalCon Dublin, but let’s just say we followed in the footsteps for the release of Drupal 8.

What has happened since having a stable 1.x version?

In terms of community inclusion, we have added a new language support for all Russian speakers.

In regards to community engagement and communication, we recently invested in the website redesign, which you can check [here](https://drupalconsole.com/). We tried to improve the UX by making the interface more simple and intuitive, and also enhanced the [documentation section](https://drupalconsole.com/docs), were we provided more visibility to language maintainers. Also, we created a mailing-list to facilitate communication with the base of users, and inform them of new features and news relevant to the project.

Getting support is one thing we wanted to improve. The Drupal Console is a community project supported by [weKnow](http://weknowinc.com), which is the company behind the project. We have added a new support section where the community can get in contact with members of the community using channels like Github, Gitter and Slack.

For those companies that require commercial support there’s now the option to get in contact with the maintainers and co-maintainers inside weKnow. This type of support can include:

- Requesting custom features.
- Sponsoring a new feature to contribute back to the community.
- Understanding and implementing a workflow of Drupal Console to be used for a multi layer development team.

In the technical side and internal affairs the most notorious features and changes are:

- Improving automation through chain commands.
- The “*composerize*” command to help you convert a Drupal codebase from non-composer to composer.
- Support for importing previously exported configuration for “*config:import*” command.
- Upgrade to Symfony 3.x.
- Twig support added to chain commands.
- Improve on-boarding contribution by creating new commands to help with those task on this repository 

What’s next?
------------

From now until the 2.0 release, Drupal Console will focus on improving and increasing the coverage of test cases to ensure that production environments will be stable.

We have also been working on the workflow field, specifically development and deployment to facilitate the life-cycle of Drupal sites.

What to expected in 2.0? Well, we are planning to match next the release of Drupal 9. It’s important for us to keep in mind the refactoring taking place in the area of publishing and content authoring.

As it happened for Drupal 8, the team behind Drupal Console wants continue evolving a tool that truly improves development cycles.
